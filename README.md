## How to run?

goldenhorse works on browsers (preferably Chrome or Firefox). It works with a set of commands typed to its command line interface so a documentation will be provided when the project is finished. To install, follow these steps:

* Download or clone the repository.
* If you don't have nodejs/npm download them.
* Go inside the repository (where server.js is), using the command line run **npm install**
* Run **node server** to start the server. You should see something like this:
